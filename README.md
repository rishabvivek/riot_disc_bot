This bot provides users with a simple way of using Discord to search for summoners in the game League of Legends. The bot works by connecting to Riot's very own API which provides a wealth of information regarding summoners from different regions. The bot provides users with specific information about a summoner such as their winrate, their most played champs and more. Moreover, the bot also provides links to a users OP.GG for further more in-depth info about the summoner. This bot leverages the Discord application and community as the League Discord community is large and therefore this bot can be very helpful to several players. The bot has a `!help` command to assist in learning more about how to utilize the bot. ENJOY!
